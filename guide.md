# Guide on how to install and use TariffFetcher (Windows)

## System requirements:
Python 3.13.2\
OS: Agnostic. Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD, Oracle Solaris (just because you can doesn't mean you should, but for this you may need to compile it yourself), AIX, whatever as long as it has a port of Python 3.13.2.\
Hardware: if you can run the OS above (non-exhaustive list), you probably can run TariffFetcher.
